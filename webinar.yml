  Join us for this live, hands-on training where you will learn techniques to
  help you clearly visualize the most stubbornly tricky big datasets. As your
  datasets get bigger, new problems begin to emerge. Having lots of
  observations, or lots of variables, or lots of categories for a variable can
  all make it harder to understand what is happening with your dataset. This
  session will run for three hours, allowing you time to really immerse yourself
  in the subject, and includes short breaks and opportunities to ask the expert
  questions throughout the training.
whatWillILearn:
  - Find ways of dealing with overplotting.
  - Learn to use correlation heatmaps.
  - Deal with extreme faceting using trelliscopes.
